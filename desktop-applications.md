## Slack

Download the [Slack Desktop Client](https://slack.com/downloads/windows). We recommend using the Desktop client over the website version of Slack because it is easier to get notifications, upload files, and do other actions. Our Slack workspace is the most active forum of our chapter. 

## Text Editor
Earlier, we installed VSCode. Open up Windows Terminal and type `code .` to create a shortcut in your terminal to open up VSCode. It's much faster than looking for a folder and then opening it in VSCode.

If the above doesn't work, press `ctrl + shift + p` to open up a bar. type path and type 'shell command' to find `Shell Command: Install 'code' in PATH` click on that button to allow you to open up vscode in your terminal using `code .` to open up VScode with the current folder loaded in.

Once you have finished installing and VSCode has opened, close your command prompt and open a new one. At the new prompt, run `code .` to ensure that your shell is correctly linked with the app.

Here are some helpful extensions you might want to install:
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- Live Server
- Prettier Code Formatter (Auto-Formatters are very controversial! Please consider before installing!)
- A beautiful and accessible VSCode theme


## Browser
We like using Chrome as our preferred browser because we like its developer console best. If you don't already have it, please follow [the installation instructions for Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en).

We also recommend you install JSON view to make it easier to see data from APIs

### Touch Typing
You will be at a serious disadvantage if you do not know how to touch type. To practice this skill we recommend [typingclub](http://typingclub.com), [speedcoder](http://www.speedcoder.net/) or [typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/).

### A word on *Keyboard Shortcuts*

By the way, developers LOVE shortcut key combinations. The more shortcuts you know, the faster you can code!

For starters, you should know how to `copy`, `paste`, and `cut`. But there are tons more [VSCode Shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf). You also have a handy shortcut for resizing and moving windows on WSL too!

`Windows Key + Left Arrow / Right Arrow` to resize your window to half of the screen and move it to the left/right side. 

`Windows Key + Up Arrow + Up Arrow` to instantly make your current window or app full screen.

Every single application above has its own list of shortcuts too!

## Postman - API Testing

Download the Postman Desktop App from https://www.postman.com/downloads/. We will not be using the chrome extension.
